# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The presentation discusses a project at Massachusetts General Hospital focusing on innovative software solutions to enhance healthcare delivery. It highlights the creation of a Clinical Data Warehouse using an ETL process involving SQL and Alteryx for data extraction, transformation, and loading. The data is then visualized in Tableau for analytics. Additionally, a mobile application is proposed to improve patient experience, streamline hospital operations, and enable data-driven decision-making. The project also involves machine learning for predicting heart disease. The presentation emphasizes the benefits of these solutions, such as improved operational efficiency and patient-centric care.
